Hi! I'm Lucy, and I'm a PhD student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Oregon, where I work with Dr. Kate Mills in the [Developing Brains in Context Lab](devbrainlab.org).

I'm interested in adolescent social and brain development, and many of my current projects focus on understanding maturation across domains. I also love taking real brains to local schools to teach kids about neuroscience!

I take a mixed-methods approach in my research, ranging from machine learning methods to participatory action research. Check out the projects tab for more information about what I'm working on!
